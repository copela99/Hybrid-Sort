# Hybrid-Sort-Implementation
I mplemented the Insertion Sort Algorithm and the Merge Sort Algorithm. I developed  Merge Sort such that it can be used as a Hybrid Sort when given a threshold value. The Hybrid Sort will rely on Merge Sort until the partitioned lists are less than or equal to a given threshold, at that point it will switch to Insertion Sort.
More information on the project can be founf in the Description.md file.
